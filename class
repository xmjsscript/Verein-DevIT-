Main classes
This library offers multiple *Client classes, which are listed below. Each one of these classes exposes all the RPCs for a service as member functions of the class. This library groups multiple services because they are part of the same product or are often used together. A typical example may be the administrative and data plane operations for a single product.

The library also has other classes that provide helpers, configuration parameters, and infrastructure to mock the *Client classes when testing your application.

cloudbuild_v1::CloudBuildClient
cloudbuild_v2::RepositoryManagerClient
